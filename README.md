# AMATH-455: Feedback Control Theory

This is the resporitory that showcases my work in AMATH 455: Feedback Control Theory at University of Waterloo in Canada.

Code is conducted mainly in MatLab.

# What is Control Theory?

Control can be very generally described as "the process of influencing the behaviour of a dynamical system to achieve a desired goal". This course is concerned with a very important type of control, feedback control. Feedback occurs in a wide variety of situations. Some examples are: regulation of blood sugar level via insulin, automobile cruise control, satellite positioning and reduction of noise and vibration in structures.

# Course description:

The basic ideas of control are described. Concepts are illustrated with examples. While students are expected to understand the theory, emphasis is placed on application of the ideas. The software program MATLAB is introduced and used throughout the course.
